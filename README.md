#  Job Market Intelligence Platform

A *data-driven job market analysis tool* that combines *web scraping, realistic dataset generation, and advanced analytics* to deliver actionable insights into the demand for technical roles and skills.

This project collects job listings (from Indeed + fallback synthetic dataset), cleans and structures the data, analyzes skill demand, company hiring patterns, and role categorization, and produces *professional-grade dashboards and CSV reports* for market intelligence.
